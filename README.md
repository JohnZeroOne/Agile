The Manifesto for Agile Software Development
Agile software development values

Based on their combined experience of developing software and helping others do that, the seventeen signatories to the manifesto proclaimed that they value:[4]

    Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools
    Working Software over comprehensive documentation
    Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation
    Responding to Change over following a plan 

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, they value the items on the left more.

As Scott Ambler elucidated:[19]

    Tools and processes are important, but it is more important to have competent people working together effectively.
    Good documentation is useful in helping people to understand how the software is built and how to use it, but the main point of development is to create software, not documentation.
    A contract is important but is no substitute for working closely with customers to discover what they need.
    A project plan is important, but it must not be too rigid to accommodate changes in technology or the environment, stakeholders' priorities, and people's understanding of the problem and its solution.

Some of the authors formed the Agile Alliance, a non-profit organization that promotes software development according to the manifesto's values and principles. Introducing the manifesto on behalf of the Agile Alliance, Jim Highsmith said,

    The Agile movement is not anti-methodology, in fact many of us want to restore credibility to the word methodology. We want to restore a balance. We embrace modeling, but not in order to file some diagram in a dusty corporate repository. We embrace documentation, but not hundreds of pages of never-maintained and rarely-used tomes. We plan, but recognize the limits of planning in a turbulent environment. Those who would brand proponents of XP or SCRUM or any of the other Agile Methodologies as "hackers" are ignorant of both the methodologies and the original definition of the term hacker.

Agile software development principles

The Manifesto for Agile Software Development is based on twelve principles:[21]

    Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software
    Welcome changing requirements, even in late development
    Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)
    Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
    Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
    Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
    Working software is the primary measure of progress
    Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
    Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
    Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
    Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
    Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly
